🔔 **New Feature: DM Notifications for Ready Checks**

**The Problem:** Missing ready checks because you're not actively watching the channel?

**The Solution:** Get a DM from the bot when a ready check starts for drafts you've signed up for!

**How to Enable:**

Use the command: `/toggle_dm_notifications`

That's it! The bot will now DM you with a link to the channel whenever a ready check is initiated.

**Note:** This is opt-in. You must enable it yourself. Run the command again to disable.
